This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>
You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Getting Started
- Run npm install in the client folder, where `package.json` lives 
- run npm start to begin the client server. Defaults to localhost:3000

##Todo
- React-Router if you want multiple pages/routes
- Hook up to redux store if state gets more complicated (right now it's all handled on local react state)
- Componentize the components if they get unwieldly
